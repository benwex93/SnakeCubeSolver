# SnakeCubeSolver
Recursive Algorithm for solving the 5x5 SnakeCube Puzzle


The Snakecube Puzzle is a 5x5 puzzle that is composed of straight (S) pieces and bend (B) pieces.
This particular cube is represented as:
SBSSBBBBBBBBBBSBBSSBBBBSSBSBBBBBBSBSBBBBBBBBBSBBSBBSBBSSBBBSBBSS
and the solution is composed of right (R), left (L), front(F), back (B), up (U), and down (D) orientations of each cube and is represented as:
RBBBLURFLDFUFRRDBBBURDFFFUUBDBLULLFFURDRURBLDDLUULBBDRRRFULLBRRR

The algorithm for finding the solution is a Depth-First-Search (DFS) recursion and finds all possible solutions.
